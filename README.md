# V2EX API Wrapper for iOS / MacOS

An unofflical Objective-C API wrapper for [Project Babel 2](https://github.com/livid/v2ex). 

**Now compatible with Project Babel 3.**

__Lightweight fork comming soonâ€¦__


## Features

* Singleton. `[V2EXAPIWrapper shared]`
* Block based instance methods.
* CoreData powered presistent requests for offline cache.


## Dependences & Requirements

* [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods). Make sure to run `pod install` before compiling. After that RestKit 0.10.0 would be installed.
* iOS 4.3+ / Mac OS X 10.6+ 
* XCode 4+


## Usage

`#import "V2EXAPIWrapper.h"`

Dumping all nodes asynchronously is very easy:

    [[V2EXAPIWrapper shared] loadNodes:^(NSError *error, NSArray *nodes) {
        NSMutableArray *nodesArray = [NSMutableArray array];
        for (V2EXNode *node in nodes) {
            [nodesArray addObject:node.title];
        }
        NSLog(@"Nodes: %@", [nodesArray componentsJoinedByString:@","]);
    }];

See also *V2EXAPIWrapper.h* for more methods.
